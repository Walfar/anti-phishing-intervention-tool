  The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of personalized and human-centered inter-
ventions in assisting users in identifying phishing emails. While previous research has identified
various human factors that contribute to susceptibility to phishing attacks, limited knowledge ex-
ists on the most effective interventions for different user categories. This study seeks to determine
the effectiveness of diverse interventions based on user groups categorized by prior knowledge on
phishing, frequency of email use and email rate as influencing factors in the literature. Specifically,
the investigation compared different groups of people and examined the impact of education on
low-knowledge users and the impact of training on low to medium knowledge users. Furthermore,
I investigated if awareness alerts were effective for all users, including those with high knowledge.
Additionally, the study explored potential correlations between personality traits, demographic
factors, and the effectiveness of the interventions. The findings from this study could inform the
further development of a personalized anti-phishing tool, potentially leading to the creation of a
fully functional Gmail plug-in or an application that incorporates the identified effective interven
tions.
